Steps to Deploy on Render (Example)
1. Prepare Your Project
Ensure your project is ready for deployment:

All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

Your Flask/Django app has a Procfile (for Render) or Dockerfile (optional).

Environment variables (e.g., API keys) are stored securely.

Example Procfile for Flask:
Copy
web: gunicorn app:app
Example requirements.txt:
Copy
Flask==2.3.2
gunicorn==20.1.0
python-docx==0.8.11
langchain==0.0.200
2. Push Your Code to GitHub
Create a GitHub repository.

Push your project code to the repository.

bash
Copy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
