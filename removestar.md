To clean up the response generated by the **Gemini API** (or any other text generation API), you can **remove the double stars (`**`) from headings** and **replace single stars (`*`) with dashes (`-`)**. This can be done using Python's string manipulation methods. Below, Iâ€™ll show you how to implement this in your backend code.

---

## **Steps to Clean Up the Response**

### **1. Identify the Problem**
- **Double Stars (`**`)**: These are often used to denote headings in Markdown or other formats.
- **Single Stars (`*`)**: These are often used for bullet points or subheadings.

Example Gemini API response:
```
**Job Title: Software Engineer**
* Required Skills: Python, Django, AWS
* Company Culture: Innovative, Collaborative
* Additional Details: Remote, Full-time
```

Desired output:
```
Job Title: Software Engineer
- Required Skills: Python, Django, AWS
- Company Culture: Innovative, Collaborative
- Additional Details: Remote, Full-time
```

---

### **2. Modify the Backend Code**
Add a function to clean up the response before saving it to the `.doc` file.

#### **Backend Code (Flask/Django)**:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
from docx import Document
import io

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/generate-doc', methods=['POST'])
def generate_doc():
    # Get user inputs from the form
    job_title = request.form.get('job_title')
    skills = request.form.get('skills')
    culture = request.form.get('culture')
    details = request.form.get('details')

    # Generate job description using AI (LangChain + Gemini/Grok)
    job_description = generate_job_description(job_title, skills, culture, details)

    # Clean up the response
    cleaned_description = clean_response(job_description)

    # Create a Word document
    doc = Document()
    doc.add_heading('Job Description', level=1)
    doc.add_paragraph(cleaned_description)

    # Save the document to a BytesIO object (in-memory file)
    file_stream = io.BytesIO()
    doc.save(file_stream)
    file_stream.seek(0)

    # Return the file as a downloadable .doc
    return send_file(
        file_stream,
        as_attachment=True,
        download_name='job_description.docx',
        mimetype='application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document'
    )

def generate_job_description(job_title, skills, culture, details):
    # Use LangChain and Gemini/Grok to generate the job description
    # Example: Replace this with your actual AI logic
    return f"""
    **Job Title: {job_title}**
    * Required Skills: {skills}
    * Company Culture: {culture}
    * Additional Details: {details}

    This is a sample job description generated by AI.
    """

def clean_response(text):
    # Remove double stars (**) from headings
    text = text.replace('**', '')
    
    # Replace single stars (*) with dashes (-)
    text = text.replace('*', '-')
    
    # Remove extra whitespace
    text = '\n'.join([line.strip() for line in text.split('\n')])
    
    return text

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

### **3. Explanation of the `clean_response` Function**
- **Remove Double Stars (`**`)**:
  ```python
  text = text.replace('**', '')
  ```
  This removes all occurrences of `**` from the text.

- **Replace Single Stars (`*`) with Dashes (`-`)**:
  ```python
  text = text.replace('*', '-')
  ```
  This replaces all occurrences of `*` with `-`.

- **Remove Extra Whitespace**:
  ```python
  text = '\n'.join([line.strip() for line in text.split('\n')])
  ```
  This removes leading and trailing whitespace from each line.

---

### **4. Example Input and Output**

#### **Input (Gemini API Response)**:
```
**Job Title: Software Engineer**
* Required Skills: Python, Django, AWS
* Company Culture: Innovative, Collaborative
* Additional Details: Remote, Full-time
```

#### **Output (Cleaned Text)**:
```
Job Title: Software Engineer
- Required Skills: Python, Django, AWS
- Company Culture: Innovative, Collaborative
- Additional Details: Remote, Full-time
```

---

### **5. Testing**
- Test the `clean_response` function with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.
- Verify that the cleaned text is correctly added to the `.doc` file.

---

### **6. Additional Enhancements**
If you want to further refine the cleaning process:
- **Remove Empty Lines**:
  ```python
  text = '\n'.join([line for line in text.split('\n') if line.strip()])
  ```
- **Capitalize Headings**:
  ```python
  lines = text.split('\n')
  lines[0] = lines[0].upper()  # Capitalize the first line (heading)
  text = '\n'.join(lines)
  ```

---

### **7. Final Output in `.doc` File**
The generated `.doc` file will look like this:

```
Job Description
===============

JOB TITLE: SOFTWARE ENGINEER
- Required Skills: Python, Django, AWS
- Company Culture: Innovative, Collaborative
- Additional Details: Remote, Full-time

This is a sample job description generated by AI.
```
