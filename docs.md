### **6. System Architecture**
   - **Frontend**:
     - Web form for user inputs.
     - Display area for generated job descriptions.
     - Buttons for editing, exporting, and resetting.
   - **Backend**:
     - Flask/Django server to handle requests.
     - LangChain for prompt management and AI integration.
     - Gemini or Grok API for generating job descriptions.
     - ReportLab for PDF exports.
   - **Database** (Optional):
     - Store user inputs and generated descriptions for future reference (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

---

### **7. Sample Prompts for LangChain**
   - **Initial Prompt**:
     ```
     "Generate a job description for a {job_title} role. The required skills are {skills}. The company culture is {culture}. Additional details: {details}."
     ```
   - **Tone Customization**:
     ```
     "Rewrite the job description in a {tone} tone."
     ```
   - **Editing**:
     ```
     "Edit the job description to include {additional_info}."
     ```

---

### **8. Testing Requirements**
   - **Unit Testing**:
     - Test individual components (e.g., prompt generation, API calls, PDF export).
   - **Integration Testing**:
     - Test the end-to-end flow from user input to PDF export.
   - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
     - Test the application with real HR professionals to gather feedback.

---

### **9. Deployment Requirements**
   - **Hosting**:
     - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud).
